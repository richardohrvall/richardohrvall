abstract = "In this paper we study the effects of a radical right party entering a national parliament, on the parliament discourse. We follow the classification developed by Meguid (2008) and use a probabilistic topic model approach to analyze the 300,000 speeches delivered in the Swedish parliament between 1994 and 2017."
